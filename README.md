### Why Foundry?
Although other tools like Hardhat, Ganache, Brownie, etc. are great, Foundry is a tool that allows you to do everything in one place. It is a great tool for beginners and advanced developers alike.

Starting from the fact that with Foundry, everything is run in Solidity so there is no environment change or new syntax to learn.
